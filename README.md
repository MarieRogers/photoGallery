# gallery

This gallery, created using JQuery, allows the user to interact with images by sorting and scrolling through them.

I used w3schools when creating my image gallery, especially for their checkbox styling and modal image tutorial. I also used Stack Overflow occasionally for smaller questions and http://www.my-html-codes.com to help build the slide show.

Images were taken from http://lorempixel.com.
